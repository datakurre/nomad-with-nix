Service mesh with Nomad and Nix
===============================

With Consul and HAProxy.

This exmple assumes [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) and works best with [Nix and direnv](https://nix.dev/tutorials/declarative-and-reproducible-developer-environments.html#direnv-automatically-activating-the-environment-on-directory-change).

```bash
$ nix-shell
$ make serve
```
